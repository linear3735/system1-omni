# Add a System1-Omni model

Read [README.md](../../../README.md),
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md), and applicable `AGENTS.md`
instructions from the target checkout. Paths below are relative to the repository
root. Inspect the branch, remotes, working-tree status, and affected components
before editing; preserve unrelated changes and follow the user's branch rules.

## Establish the contract

- Pin the upstream reference code, checkpoint, tokenizer, adapters, and required
  dependency versions. Check attribution and license requirements before adapting
  upstream code.
- Identify the supported modalities and question types, model identifiers, input
  limits, validation errors, output fields, and token accounting. Record deliberate
  differences from the reference and unsupported behavior.
- Trace preprocessing through the final decision: structured JSON rendering and
  ordering, prompt/chat template, special tokens, tokenization, checkpoint layout,
  tensor shapes and dtypes, trained head, calibration, normalization, ties, and
  confidence. Sharing a backbone does not imply sharing prompts or readout.
- Capture small reference fixtures before implementing native execution. Preserve
  their provenance and generation commands; declare numerical tolerances before
  comparing outputs.

Use the existing worker/frontend interface where it fits. Explain any required
interface change before implementing it; adding a model is not a reason to
redesign serving infrastructure or introduce a general model framework.

## Place and integrate the code

| Location | Changes that belong here |
| --- | --- |
| `src/models/<model>/` | Request compilation, preprocessing, tokenization, checkpoint loading, model execution, state, kernel selection, decision head, and response formatting. A native Rust worker may live in `native/`, following existing models. |
| `src/models/<family>/` | Model-family execution shared by implementations that actually need it. Reuse compatible code; extract a common implementation when there is a second user. |
| `src/backends/cuda/` or `src/backends/metal/` | Hardware-specific operations, build scripts, and kernel integration for the supported backend. |
| `src/frontend/` | Serving infrastructure and worker adapters when integration requires them. Keep model-specific inference semantics in the model implementation. |
| Root `Cargo.toml` and affected crate manifests | Workspace membership, dependencies, binaries, and explicit test registration. Update `Cargo.lock` when dependencies change. |
| `recipe/<model>/` | Checkpoint preparation/export scripts, setup and launch instructions, and example requests. Reusable runtime implementation belongs in `src/`. |
| `tests/<model>/` and `tests/<shared-component>/` | All test bodies, test helpers, and fixtures, including contract, tokenizer, checkpoint, HTTP, and kernel tests. |

**Do not add test code or fixtures under `src/`.** This includes inline Rust test
bodies and crate-local `tests/` directories nested under `src/models/` or another
`src/` directory. Existing violations are not a precedent for new code; avoid
unrelated test migrations.

Register Rust integration tests using `[[test]]` entries whose `path` points to
the repository-level `tests/` tree, relative to the crate's manifest. Tests of
private Rust items can be loaded from that tree using `#[cfg(test)]` and an
external `#[path = "..."] mod tests;`; only this registration wiring may remain
in `src/`. Verify discovery with `cargo test --locked -p <crate> -- --list` so
placing tests outside the crate does not silently omit them.

Keep normal workspace builds and CPU tests independent of GPU execution and
checkpoint downloads. Make checks requiring a checkpoint or accelerator explicit
opt-in checks and document their prerequisites. Follow the existing backend
loading/build convention; when a shared ABI changes, update its version and
consumers together and document required rebuilds.

## Validate behavior

- Test the supported request/response contract and rejection of unsupported or
  malformed inputs. Include ordering, structured values, special-token text,
  candidate limits, calibration, and token counts where they affect this model.
- Compare prompt text and token IDs exactly with the pinned reference. Compare
  numerical outputs under the declared tolerance; check decision agreement as
  well as probabilities. Report intentional API differences separately.
- Check new or changed kernels against a reference and cover relevant shapes,
  dtypes, and resource lifetimes. Revalidate existing consumers of shared execution
  or backend changes; results for the new model do not establish compatibility
  with an existing model.
- For a native worker, complete loading and a real inference before reporting
  readiness. Verify its first request after readiness and run the same request
  directly and through the Rust frontend, checking status and response behavior.
- Run the Rust workspace checks listed in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and relevant
  component checks. Disclose checks not run and why; compilation, skipped tests,
  and CPU fixtures do not establish GPU or full-checkpoint parity.

Follow the execution host's reservation rules for all GPU device work. Run
performance experiments only within the requested scope. For measured claims,
follow [the benchmark protocol](../../../benchmarks/README.md): freeze revisions,
controls, tolerances and the run budget, preserve raw results, and separate
preparation, readiness, first inference, warm latency, and output fidelity.

## Update the documentation with the implementation

| File | Required content or update |
| --- | --- |
| `src/models/<model>/README.md` | Pinned artifacts and upstream reference, inference and API mapping, supported scope, validation criteria, implementation status, and links to the recipe and tests. |
| `recipe/<model>/README.md` or a focused recipe such as `native.md` | Prerequisites and dependencies, pinned downloads, export/setup, backend and worker build, environment variables, worker and frontend launch, health and a real example request, validation commands, and limitations. State the command working directory and any substantial RAM, storage, or device requirements. |
| Root `README.md` | Supported-model status and links. Update implementation-status prose or workspace descriptions when the new model makes them stale. Distinguish implemented support from planned work and tested hardware from build targets. |
| `recipe/README.md` | A discoverable link to the new recipe with its actual scope. |
| `mkdocs.yml` | Navigation for new public recipe or documentation pages; adjust `exclude_docs` only if a page or asset would otherwise be excluded. |
| Affected shared model/backend READMEs and recipes | New shared ownership, build/ABI requirements, and instructions for existing consumers when their setup changes. |
| `docs/` | Reproducible validation or benchmark evidence when needed; put documentation images in `docs/assets/`. |

Keep configuration names, commands, identifiers, limits, and examples consistent
with the code. Label unverified modalities, backends, hardware, and optimizations
explicitly. Do not describe reference fixtures or a narrow performance run as
general accuracy parity or an aggregate speedup.

Follow the documentation-site conventions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: use repository
relative links, add pages to navigation when appropriate, and keep linked pages
and images within the published set. Hidden skill files are not site pages; the
existing MkDocs hook routes links to them and other unpublished source files to
GitHub. Run `mkdocs build --strict` with `docs/requirements.txt` installed in an
appropriate environment, and check links and commands in the model README and
skill files that the site build excludes.

## Prepare the review

Summarize the implemented scope, contract differences, changed shared components,
checks and results, and remaining coverage gaps. Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the
PR template; use [precheck-pr](../precheck-pr/SKILL.md) for agent-assisted
self-review before requesting maintainer review. Follow the user's authorization
for commits, pushes, and PR creation.

## Worked examples

- [PR #19](https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/system1-omni/pull/19): native Cua-S1
  execution checked against a reference worker, checkpoint export, CUDA build,
  and numerical validation.
- [PR #55](https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/system1-omni/pull/55): Open-Jev's
  model-specific candidate scoring and calibration, shared Qwen execution, and
  registration of tests from the repository-level tree.

Read the relevant implementation and final diff when using an example. Historical
PR paths and behavior may differ from the target checkout; the placement rules
above apply even when an older example stores tests under `src/`.
