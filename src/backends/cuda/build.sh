# This is a wrapper, not a replacement: `tools/export.py` generates the CUDA
# source from TileLang and `tools/build.py` compiles it, exactly as
# recipe/laya/native/README.md documents. Keeping a single entry point means CI
# can build this backend the same way it builds any other, without knowing that
# this one happens to be generated rather than hand-written.
#
# It does NOT remove TileLang from the build: export.py imports it, so a machine
# building this bundle needs TileLang installed. Checking in the generated
# `generated.cu` and compiling only that with nvcc is a separate change, and the
# model owner's call.
#
#   BUILD_STAGE=<dir>   stage the export there (default: a fresh mktemp -d)
#   KEEP_STAGE=1        keep the staging directory and print its path
#   PYTHON=<python>     interpreter for the tools (default: python3, else python)
#   NVCC / CUDA_HOME    as tools/build.py reads them
#
# A checkpoint is not needed here. `tools/export_tables.py` needs one; it is a
# separate step in the recipe and is not required to produce the library.
